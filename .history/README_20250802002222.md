## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnupriyaBiswas/Data-Structure-Algorithm-Design.git
cd Data-Structure-Algorithm-Design
````

2. **Compile and Run**


```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
```

Replace `filename.cpp` with the algorithm or data structure file you want to test.

---

## 📊 Example Usage

```cpp
// Example: Running a Binary Search
int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};
int target = 7;
int index = binarySearch(arr, 5, target);
cout << "Target found at index: " << index << endl;
```

Output:

```
Target found at index: 3
```

## 📌 Future Work

* Add more real-world problem statements
* Include time & space complexity analysis for each implementation
* Add test cases and unit tests
